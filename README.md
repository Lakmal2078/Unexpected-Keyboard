# Unexpected Keyboard

> A lightweight, privacy-focused, and developer-friendly Android virtual keyboard designed for speed, customization, and multilingual typing.

Unexpected Keyboard replaces traditional multi-page keyboard layouts with intuitive swipe gestures on individual keys. Swipe up, down, or towards corners to instantly access numbers, punctuation, special symbols, and modifier keys without switching screens.

## Key Features

- **Browser & WebView Optimized**: Features native `InputConnection` batching and Unicode grapheme cluster calculation (`BreakIterator`) for fluid typing in mobile web browsers.
- **Smart Snippets & Calculator**: Instant text snippets (e.g., `//shrug` → `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`, `//sinhala` → `සිංහල`) and inline mathematical calculations.
- **Customizable Themes**: Multiple built-in light, dark, AMOLED, and high-contrast accessibility themes.

> [!NOTE]
> Unexpected Keyboard is engineered for privacy and low memory footprint. It contains no telemetry, analytics, or background tracking services.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lakmal2078/Unexpected-Keyboard.git
   cd Unexpected-Keyboard
   ```

2. Make the Gradle wrapper executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x gradlew
   ```

3. Build the Debug APK:
